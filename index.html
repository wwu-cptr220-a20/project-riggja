                It would be cool to have a website where we can post information about the club. we can show the club officers, post events, have a comment section for members to add ideas or talk about homework help.
                we can put a page on there for good interview question practice, as well as how to do basic git or environment set-up.
                this way any freshman CS major has a one stop place to find any help or information about the club and other CS related topics.
                this way we can help not only boost the awareness of the club but also provide a platform that acts as a virtual meeting place for CS club members.
                We can also use it as a platform for the club members to learn and practice html to up keep the site.
                <a href="https://www.acm.org/"> Here </a> is the ACM site (our parent club).
